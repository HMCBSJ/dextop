# Linux on Android -  Termux // Dextop // Ubuntu
  
![termux dextop](https://github.com/nathaneltitane/dextop/blob/master/termux.png?raw=true)

This project provides any user owning a modern android device, the ability to setup their own Linux-based work environment and use it as their primary workstation.

### Requirements:
- Modern Android device (running android 7.0+ / Termux limitation)
- Mouse (bluetooth or other)
- Keyboard (bluetooth or other)
- Power source (for extended work periods and performance requirements)
- Monitor (highly recommended)
- Internet connectivity (for setup, updates and additional package downloads)

### Getting started:
- Install the [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux "Termux by Fredrik Fornwall") application
- Install a VNC viewer application with full screen or immersive capabillities for a better experience such as [bVNC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.freebVNC "bVNC by Iordan Iordanov")

### Setup:

Once the Android applications are installed on your device, open Termux and paste:

```curl -sL run.dxtp.app > setup && bash setup | <option>```

Available install options are:

```-f | --full: download and install full desktop environment and utilities. ( xfce4 )```

```-m | --minimal: download and install minimal desktop environment and utilities. ( dwm ) [ Default ]```

### Note:
The setup speed greatly depends on your device model and internet connection speed.
Let the setup run and fetch all the required dependencies: it will prompt you for input once it is ready.
The rest of the setup is fully automated and should run its course until the proot environment is ready for you to use.

**Be attentive!**

**User input is required to capture necessary setup information and give Termux storage access permissions:**
**this can only be done through user interaction and there are no workarounds.**

### Process:
- The script goes through usual update and upgrade processes using apt to get the Termux system up to date and ready.
- Necessary dependencies, configurations and binaries are downloaded and set up in both the Termux and proot environment.
- Information is then captured to properly configure and setup a user environment in the proot.
- The base ubuntu image is downloaded, unpacked and setup from within the Termux environment.
- The setup transitions into the newly unpacked proot environment and proceeds with configuring and installing the rest of your setup.

### Note:
The setup dialogs, prompts, comaands and binaries have been made to redirect all output to the Termux ```'/var/log'``` directory, keeping output messages to a minimum.

### Customization:

Use the 'proot-applications' script to customize your list of installed applications, libraries, frameworks and utilities.

Should you suspect any issues or errors, please provide those files when submitting a bug report.

### Usage:

On Termux load:

- Run ```'proot-launch <username>'```               to start your session.
- Run ```'proot-launch <username> <application>'``` to start a specific application on session load.

When in the proot environment:

- Run ```'vnc-start'``` to start your session."

### Note:
If you've already logged in, your selection has been saved for automatic startup on shell login under ```"${HOME}"/.vnc/selection```.

Logging out will automatically stop all vnc servers and exit the proot environment back to the Termux shell
- Run ```'logout'``` / Ctrl+D
